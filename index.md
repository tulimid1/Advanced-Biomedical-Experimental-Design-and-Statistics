Each lecture has it's own folder. Inside that folder, you'll find a .ipynb that has the Python equivalent of the R code provided in the lecture. Below are hyperlinks to each week.

Notes: Things get a bit dicey during ANOVA part. [pingouin](https://pingouin-stats.org/api.html) is a great package for this section. I bet it can handle everything and make some things a bit easier (pairwise comparisons), but it still has some bugs that need to be worked out. 

[Issues](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/issues) and [Discussion](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/discussions).
