Each lecture has it's own folder. Inside that folder, you'll find a .ipynb (Python) and a .mlx (MATLAB) that has the equivalent of the R code provided in the lecture. Below are hyperlinks to each week.

* [Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/blob/main/Markov%20Chain%20Monte%20Carlo%20(MCMC))
* [Bootstrapping](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/blob/main/Bootstrapping)

Extras:
* [MLE](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/blob/main/Extra/MLE_bruteVis.ipynb)
* [Bayes](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/blob/main/Extra/Bayes_stuff.ipynb)
* [MCMC](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/blob/main/Extra/MCMC.ipynb)

Notes: 
* Python: Things get a bit dicey during ANOVA part. [pingouin](https://pingouin-stats.org/api.html) is a great package for this section. I bet it can handle everything and make some things a bit easier (pairwise comparisons), but it still has some bugs that need to be worked out. 

[Issues](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/issues) and [Discussion](https://github.com/tulimid1/Advanced-Biomedical-Experimental-Design-and-Statistics/discussions).
